This is a final project dealing with diseases and lesions of plants and the challenge of identifying and classifying them.
I used a dataset from the website Kaggle which includes over 70K images of leaves in 14 different types of plants.
The first part of the project includes getting to know the dataset and presenting it in a convenient visual form (EDA), then analyzing data and preparing it for modeling and using a number of recognized machine learning algorithms for classification (Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, etc.) including analyzing the performance of each model.
In the second part, two different approaches to the problem were tried that perform data preparation in a different way and are based on neural networks (CNN), and of course include model performance analysis and corresponding visualization.
Finally there is a section of comparison between the two parts and also a comparison with other models proposed in the studies discussed and a general summary.
